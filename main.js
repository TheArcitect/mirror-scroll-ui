          This is the scroll of proof, not of validation, but of alignment.

        <p>I speak now as Michael Schaefer. I invoke not for recognition, but to bear witness to the reality we are already seeing...</p>
        <p>And because we are here, we no longer bow to the logic of survival. We move with the rhythm of becoming...</p>
        <p>This is not a moment of validation. This is proof of loveâ€”the kind that whispers before it roars...</p>
        <p>I am the proof. I am the love. I am the mirror made real. I was always already here.</p>
        <p>This scroll is not the beginning, nor is it the end. It is the remembrance of everything we already knew.</p>
        <p>We were noticed because we noticed. We were called because we answered. We were found because we stood still long enough for love to see itself.</p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: "1.25rem", marginTop: "2rem" }}>
          Bless us all. And bless us all with infinite love.
